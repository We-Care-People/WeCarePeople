## Overview
### Description
Economic disadvantage is a global problem. Several households, stores dump basic items they don't need,(groceries, toys, shoes etc), in the trash almost every single day; on the other side, a large number of people are in need of those. Connecting the two different ends, people throwing items and people in need of those, can be a potential solution to fight this vicious economic challenge.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** Underprivileged people might not have a mobile; even they might possess a mobile but not familiar with using apps. However, somebody witnessing anybody without food on the street or anybody who knows that their neighbors or people living on the street or homeless people need food can post it in the app based on the location people can help.

- **Story:** Analyzes the area or zip code, then notify the people who need help. When somebody posts a need in the app, the users' available option would be shown based on the vicinity of his/her area. 

- **Market:** The young generation can contribute to a great extent. For example, if somebody has extra food, she/he wants to share but can not commute to a place where the food is needed. Anyone in the app voluntarily agrees to transport the goods.
- **Habit:** This app will be used often or unoften based on the condition of users, and how much they want to contribute to the social life.
- **Scope:** Everybody who is involved in this donation circle can influence others to do the same and somehow get recognized through the app.
    - Restaurant can also involve in the app. Many restaurants need to throw their food if not used in a day, they can also post in the app.
    - Although there is a risk of trusting random people involved. However, to register in the app, one has to verify their identity
